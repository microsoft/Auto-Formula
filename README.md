# Auto-Formula: Recommend Formulas in Spreadsheets using Contrastive Learning for Table Representations

 

## Overview

This benchmark dataset contains real Excel spreadsheets, cralwed from the public web in 3 domains: 
- Cisco (cisco.com)
- PGE (pge.com)
- TI (ti.com)
- Enron (this is from the publicly available Enron spreadsheet dataset https://github.com/SheetJS/enron_xls)


We used real formulas extracted from the aforementioned spreadsheets, to test different algorithms' ability to predict and recommend formulas that users want to author in a target spreadsheet cell (using the actual formula in the cell as the ground-truth) [1]. 

We hope the release of this spreadsheet data set can facilitate futureu research on related topics.
